      A croissant is a French pastry known for its buttery, flaky texture and
      distinctive crescent shape. It is made from a yeast-leavened laminated
      dough, which involves layering dough with butter, rolling it out, folding
      it multiple times, and then rolling it into a thin sheet. This process,
      called lamination, creates the croissantâ€™s characteristic layers.

      The croissant has its origins in the Austrian kipferl, a crescent-shaped
      pastry that dates back to at least the 13th century. The modern croissant,
      however, was developed in France in the early 20th century.

      Croissants are typically enjoyed for breakfast or as a snack, often served
      with coffee or tea. They can be plain or filled with various ingredients
      like chocolate, almond paste, or ham and cheese.
